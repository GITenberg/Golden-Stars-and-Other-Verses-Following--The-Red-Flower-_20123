<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE</h2>


<p>The only reason for printing this little book is that many people have
expressed a desire to have the memorial poem, "Golden Stars," in a
permanent form.</p>

<p>The other verses are included simply because they are a wayside record
of some of the varied feelings of an old lover of peace who was willing
to fight for it,&mdash;feelings which may find a response in other American
hearts.</p>

I have no joy in strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace is my great desire;</span><br />
Yet God forbid I lose my life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through fear to face the fire.</span><br />

A peaceful man must fight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that which peace demands,&mdash;</span><br />
Freedom and faith, honor and right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Defend with heart and hands.</span><br />

Farewell, my friendly books;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell, ye woods and streams;</span><br />
The fate that calls me forward looks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a duty beyond dreams.</span><br />

Oh, better to be dead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a face turned to the sky,</span><br />
Than live beneath a slavish dread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And serve a giant lie.</span><br />

Stand up, my heart, and strive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the things most dear to thee!</span><br />
Why should we care to be alive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless the world is free?</span><br />

<p>The winds of war-news change and veer<br />
Now westerly and full of cheer,<br />
Now easterly, depressing, sour<br />
With tidings of the Teutons' power.</p>

<p>But thou, America, whose heart<br />
With brave Allies has taken part,<br />
Be not a weathercock to change<br />
With these wild winds that shift and range.</p>

<p>Be thou a compass ever true,<br />
Through sullen clouds or skies of blue,<br />
To that great star which rules the night,&mdash;<br />
The star of Liberty and Right.</p>

<p>Lover of peace, oh set thy soul,<br />
Thy strength, thy wealth, thy conscience whole,<br />
To win the peace thine eyes foresee,&mdash;<br />
The triumph of Democracy.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of hatred, as many kinds of fire;<br />
And some are fierce and fatal with murderous desire;<br />
And some are mean and craven, revengeful, sullen, slow,<br />
They hurt the man that holds them more than they hurt his foe.</p>

<p>And yet there is a hatred that purifies the heart:<br />
The anger of the better against the baser part,<br />
Against the false and wicked, against the tyrant's sword,<br />
Against the enemies of love, and all that hate the Lord.</p>

<p>O cleansing indignation, O flame of righteous wrath,<br />
Give me a soul to feel thee and follow in thy path!<br />
Save me from selfish virtue, arm me for fearless fight,<br />
And give me strength to carry on, a soldier of the Right!</p>

O dark the night and dim the day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When first our flag arose;</span><br />
It fluttered bravely in the fray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet o'erwhelming foes.</span><br />
Our fathers saw the splendor shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dared and suffered all;</span><br />
They won our freedom by the sign&mdash;<br />
The holy sign, the radiant sign&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the stars that never fall.</span><br />

All hail to thee, Young Glory!<br />

O wild the later storm that shook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pillars of the State,</span><br />
When brother against brother took<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The final arms of fate.</span><br />
But union lived and peace divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enfolded brothers all;</span><br />
The flag floats o'er them with the sign&mdash;<br />
The loyal sign, the equal sign&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the stars that never fall.</span><br />

<p><i>Chorus</i></p>

All hail to thee, Old Glory!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thee our heart's desire</span><br />
Foretells a golden story,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the things that shall not be!</span><br />
Thy sister banners hold the line;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To thee, dear flag, they call;</span><br />
And thou hast joined them with the sign&mdash;<br />
The heavenly sign, the victor sign&mdash;<br />

<p>Who knows how many thousand years ago<br />
The twelvefold Zodiac was made to show<br />
The course of stars above and men below?</p>

<p>The great sun plows his furrow by its "lines":<br />
From all its "houses" mystic meaning shines:<br />
Deep lore of life is written in its "signs."</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Aries</i>&mdash;Sacrifice.</span><br />

<p>Snow-white and sacred is the sacrifice<br />
That Heaven demands for what our heart doth prize:<br />
The man who fears to suffer, ne'er can rise.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Taurus</i>&mdash;Strength.</span><br />

<p>Rejoice, my friend, if God has made you strong:<br />
Put forth your force to move the world along:<br />
Yet never shame your strength to do a wrong.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gemini</i>&mdash;Brotherhood.</span><br />

<p>Bitter his life who lives for self alone,<br />
Poor would he be with riches and a throne:<br />
But friendship doubles all we are and own.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cancer</i>&mdash;The Wisdom of Retreat.</span><br />

<p>Learn from the crab, O runner fresh and fleet,<br />
Sideways to move, or backward, when discreet;<br />
Life is not all advance,&mdash;sometimes retreat!</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Leo</i>&mdash;Fire.</span><br />

<p>The sign of Leo is the sign of fire.<br />
Hatred we hate: but no man should desire<br />
A heart too cold to flame with righteous ire.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Virgo</i>&mdash;Love.</span><br />

<p>Mysterious symbol, words are all in vain<br />
To tell the secret power by which you reign,<br />
The more we love, the less we can explain.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Libra</i>&mdash;Justice.</span><br />

<p>Examine well the scales with which you weigh;<br />
Let justice rule your conduct every day;<br />
For when you face the Judge you'll need fair play</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Scorpio</i>&mdash;Self-Defense.</span><br />

<p>There's not a creature in the realm of night<br />
But has the wish to live, likewise the right:<br />
Don't tread upon the scorpion, or he'll fight.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Sagittarius</i>&mdash;The Archer.</span><br />

<p>Life is an arrow, therefore you must know<br />
What mark to aim at, how to use the bow,&mdash;<br />
Then draw it to the head and let it go!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Capricornus</i>&mdash;The Goat.</span><br />

<p>The goat looks solemn, yet he likes to run,<br />
And leap the rocks, and gambol in the sun:<br />
The truly wise enjoy a little fun.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Aquarius</i>&mdash;Water.</span><br />

<p>"Like water spilt upon the ground,"&mdash;alas,<br />
Our little lives flow swiftly on and pass;<br />
Yet may they bring rich harvests and green grass!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Pisces</i>&mdash;The Fishes.</span><br />

<p>Last of the sacred signs, ye bring to me<br />
A word of hope, a word of mystery,&mdash;<br />
We all are swimmers in God's mighty sea.</p>

<p>Under the cloud of world-wide war,<br />
While earth is drenched with sorrow,<br />
I have no heart for idle merrymaking,<br />
Or for the fashioning of glad raiment.&mdash;<br />
I will retrace the divine footmarks,<br />
On the Road of the first Easter</p>

<p>Down through the valley of utter darkness<br />
Dripping with blood and tears;<br />
Over the hill of the skull, the little hill of great anguish,<br />
The ambuscade of Death.<br />
Into the no-man's-land of Hades<br />
Bearing despatches of hope to spirits in prison,<br />
Mortally stricken and triumphant<br />
Went the faithful Captain of Salvation.</p>

<p>Then upward, swiftly upward,&mdash;<br />
Victory, liberty, glory,<br />
The feet that were wounded walked in the tranquil garden,<br />
Bathed in dew and the light of deathless dawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
O my soul, my comrades, soldiers of freedom,<br />
Follow the pathway of Easter, for there is no other,<br />
Follow it through to peace, yea, follow it fighting.</p>

<p>This Armageddon is not darker than Calvary.<br />
The day will break when the Dragon is vanquished;<br />
He that exalteth himself as God shall be cast down,<br />
And the Lords of war shall fall,<br />
And the long, long terror be ended,<br />
Victory, justice, peace enduring!<br />
They that die in this cause shall live forever,<br />
And they that live shall never die,<br />
They shall rejoice together in the Easter of a new world.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>It was my lot of late to travel far<br />
Through all America's domain,<br />
A willing, grey-haired servitor<br />
Bearing the Fiery Cross of righteous war.<br />
And everywhere, on mountain, vale and plain,<br />
In crowded street and lonely cottage door,<br />
I saw the symbol of the bright blue star.<br />
Millions of stars! Rejoice, dear land, rejoice<br />
That God hath made thee great enough to give<br />
Beneath thy starry flag unfurled<br />
A gift to all the world,&mdash;<br />
Thy living sons that Liberty might live.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>II</p>

<p>It seems but yesterday they sallied forth<br />
Boys of the east, the west, the south, the north,<br />
High-hearted, keen, with laughter and with song,<br />
Fearless of lurking danger on the sea,<br />
Eager to fight in Flanders or in France<br />
Against the monstrous German wrong,<br />
And sure of victory!<br />
Brothers in soul with British and with French<br />
They held their ground in many a bloody trench;<br />
And when the swift word came&mdash;<br />
<i>Advance!</i><br />
Over the top they went through waves of flame,&mdash;<br />
Confident, reckless, irresistible,<br />
Real Americans,&mdash;<br />
Their rush was never stayed<br />
Until the foe fell back, defeated and dismayed.<br />
O land that bore them, write upon thy roll<br />
Of battles won<br />
To liberate the human soul,<br />
Ch&acirc;teau Thierry and Saint Mihiel<br />
And the fierce agony of the Argonne;<br />
Yea, count among thy little rivers, dear<br />
Because of friends whose feet have trodden there,<br />
The Marne, the Meuse, and the Moselle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>III</p>

<p>Now the vile sword<br />
In Potsdam forged and bathed in hell,<br />
Is beaten down, the victory given<br />
To the sword forged in faith and bathed in heaven.<br />
Now home again our heroes come:<br />
Oh, welcome them with bugle and with drum,<br />
Ring bells, blow whistles, make a joyful noise<br />
Unto the Lord,<br />
And welcome home our blue-star boys,<br />
Whose manhood has made known<br />
To all the world America,<br />
Unselfish, brave and free, the Great Republic,<br />
Who lives not to herself alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>But many a lad we hold<br />
Dear in our heart of hearts<br />
Is missing from the home-returning host.<br />
Ah, say not they are lost,<br />
For they have found and given their life<br />
In sacrificial strife:<br />
Their service stars have changed from blue to gold!<br />
That sudden rapture took them far away,<br />
Yet are they here with us today,<br />
Even as the heavenly stars we cannot see<br />
Through the bright veil of sunlight<br />
Shed their influence still<br />
On our vexed life, and promise peace<br />
From God to all men of good will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>V</p>

<p>What wreaths shall we entwine
For our dear boys to deck their holy shrine?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mountain-laurel, morning-glory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goldenrod and asters blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purple loosestrife, prince's-pine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wild-azalea, meadow-rue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nodding-lilies, columbine,&mdash;</span><br />
All the native blooms that grew<br />
In these fresh woods and pastures new,<br />
Wherein they loved to ramble and to play.<br />
Bring no exotic flowers:<br />
America was in their hearts,<br />
And they are ours<br />
For ever and a day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>VI</p>

O happy warriors, forgive the tear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falling from eyes that miss you;</span><br />
Forgive the word of grief from mother-lips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ne'er on earth shall kiss you;</span><br />
Hear only what our hearts would have you hear,&mdash;<br />
Glory and praise and gratitude and pride<br />
From the dear country in whose cause you died.<br />
Now you have run your race and won your prize,<br />
Old age shall never burden you, the fears<br />
And conflicts that beset our lingering years<br />
Shall never vex your souls in Paradise.<br />
Immortal, young, and crowned with victory,<br />
From life's long battle you have found release.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And He who died for all on Calvary</span><br />
Has welcomed you, brave soldiers of the cross,<br />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into eternal Peace.</span><br />

<p>Come, let us gird our loins and lift our load,<br />
Companions who are left on life's rough road,<br />
And bravely take the way that we must tread<br />
To keep true faith with our beloved dead.<br />
To conquer war they dared their lives to give,<br />
To safeguard peace our hearts must learn to live.<br />
Help us, dear God, our forward faith to hold!<br />
We want a better world than that of old.<br />
Lead us on paths of high endeavor,<br />
Toiling upward, climbing ever,<br />
Ready to suffer for the right,<br />
Until at last we gain a loftier height,<br />
More worthy to behold<br />
Our guiding stars, our hero-stars of gold.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
